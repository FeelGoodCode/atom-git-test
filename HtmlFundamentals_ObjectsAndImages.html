    <h1>HTML Fundamentals - Objects & Images</h1>
    <p>HTML objects are things like plug-ins like Flash, Silverlight, etc. Other
       objects are applets and videos. Html images reference image files.</p>
    <p>Image sizing matters, especially when it comes to tranlating pages for
       mobile.  So use the sizing attributes for page layout, but make sure the
       size of the image is appropriate to begin with so you aren't taking a hit
       on the downloading images of unnecessarily large sizes, given the sizing
       that happens in html.</p>
